# A. Three Numbers on the Blackboard

# Rain is falling outside the Fairy Warehouse, so Chtholly, Nephren, and Ithea spend the afternoon playing a game in the common room.

# Ithea writes three non-negative integers a
# , b
# , and c
#  on the blackboard.

# Chtholly may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):

# Choose one of the three current integers and replace it with the sum of the other two current integers. The other two integers remain unchanged.
# For example, starting from (3,5,11)
# , she can replace 11
#  with 3+5
# , obtaining (3,5,8)
# .

# Nephren wants to know the minimum range∗
#  of the three integers that Chtholly can obtain. Help her find it!

# ∗
# The range of a non-empty finite collection of numbers is defined as its maximum value minus its minimum value. In particular, the range of three numbers x
# , y
# , and z
#  is max(x,y,z)−min(x,y,z)
# .

# Input
# Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
#  (1≤t≤100
# ). The description of the test cases follows.

# The only line of each test case contains three integers a
# , b
# , and c
#  (0≤a,b,c≤109
# ) — the integers initially written on the blackboard.

# Output
# For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible range of the three integers.
